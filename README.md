### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Elijah, a full-stack web developer, and once in a while app developer. I major in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and everything that has to do with these cool guys. Interesting thing is I love talking about web development, that is why I blog.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Chevri. Chevri is the next big thing in time management and planning. Hopefully you will use it soon.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything/anything. Yeah I never stop learning. But that doesn't make me jump into new tech stack to learn it. I do a lot of review, read a lot of articles, watch a lot of videos before deciding to learn a framework/language

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with [devRoadMap](https://devroadmap.vercel.app). devRoadMap is a simple website I made for people who want to learn programming but have no idea to get started. It porvides a road map dependening on the user's interest. I'm looking for help on more resources for this wonderful website

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about web development

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I am reachable via [twitter @elijahtrillionz](https://twitter.com/elijahtrillionz), [marketing email](mailto:onlinedailyblog@gmail.com)

- âš¡ Fun fact: getting to know me is a forever fun fact (f3) (honestly wanna make it f-cube but I don't know how it's done with my keyboard, or let's just say f^3. Happy now)

### Some of My Notable Projects

#### [Initial SortCode](https://initial-sortcode.vercel.app/)

Initial Sortcode is an app for coding exercises and quizzes. It was inspired by the Facebook 2021 Hackathon, I was just about 4 months old in coding then. And yeah I didn't win.

Tasks:

- provide solutions in different languages (about 8 of them) to coding tasks based on three levels beginners, intermediates, and experts
- view solutions by other developers
- like a solution
- bookmark a solution
- benchmark a solution to see which is more efficient in speed
- view all task solutions you have provided based on the three levels listed above
- level up in the ultimate task leaderboard - showing top developers with the highest number of likes per solutions

Quizzes:

- pick an answer from two/four options
- see solution to the answer
- view history of quizzes answered
- level up in the ultimate quiz leaderboard - showing top developers with the most score

But to access all these cool features you will have to register/login with GitHub/Discord

#### [TrillSound](https://trillsound.vercel.app/)

TrillSound is an app for downloading Gospel songs - specifically [Loveworld](pastorchrisonline.org) songs. It contains a list of 

- trending songs (calculated based on views and downloads), 
- trending artists - a bio of each artist exists, 
- trending songs of the previous month (based on when it was uploaded)
- recently uploaded songs, and alphabetically ordered songs/artists

Each of the songs are categorized into different genres and can be as well sorted by trending, recently uploaded, and alphabetical order.

It also contains a customized audio player that let's you play the song before download.

The website also contains an admin dashboard, where admins can login and upload, view, and delete songs/bios.

If you're going to visit the website now, kindly let our [heroku dyno wake up first](https://dev.to/elijahtrillionz/your-heroku-app-is-slow-to-load-because-of-this-4lep). If you know you know :)

#### [SortCode](https://sortcode.vercel.app/)

This is the new SortCode, totally different purposes. Yeah am not very good with naming.

#### [LionTaxi / LionTaxi Drivers / LionTaxi Admin Dashboard](https://liontaxi.vercel.app/)

#### [MaProfile](https://maprofile-vercel.vercel.app/)

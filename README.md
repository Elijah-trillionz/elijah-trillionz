### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Elijah, a full-stack web developer, and once in a while app developer. I major in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and everything that has to do with these cool guys. Interesting thing is I love talking about web development, that is why I blog.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Chevri. Chevri is the next big thing in time management and planning. Hopefully you will use it soon.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything/anything. Yeah I never stop learning. But that doesn't make me jump into new tech stack to learn it. I do a lot of review, read a lot of articles, watch a lot of videos before deciding to learn a framework/language

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with [devRoadMap](https://devroadmap.vercel.app). devRoadMap is a simple website I made for people who want to learn programming but have no idea to get started. It porvides a road map dependening on the user's interest. I'm looking for help on more resources for this wonderful website

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about web development

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I am reachable on [twitter @elijahtrillionz](https://twitter.com/elijahtrillionz), [marketing email](mailto:onlinedailyblog@gmail.com)

- âš¡ Fun fact: getting to know me is a forever fun fact (f3) (honestly wanna make it f-cube but I don't know how it's done with my keyboard, or let's just say f^3. Happy now)
